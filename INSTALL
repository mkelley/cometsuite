Requirements
============

CometSuite requries libgetxyz, available at:

    http://www.astro.umd.edu/~msk/projects/dust-dynamics/

Also required are cfitsio and CCfits from NASA's High Energy
Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center:

    http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/

The error "ranlib: for architecture: x86_64 file:
libcfitsio.a(drvrgsiftp.o) has no symbols" can be ignored when
compiling cfitsio.

Basic Installation
==================

Briefly, the shell commands:

    ./configure
    make

should configure and build the package.  Additionally,

    make install

will install it.  There are two configure options immediately relevant
to the CometSuite user:

    --prefix=/path/for/installation

I recommend setting --prefix to a CometSuite specific directory, such as:

    --prefix=$HOME/Projects/cometsuite

although any location, such as /usr/local/, will do.

Now, build and install CometSuite:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/Projects/cometsuite
    make
    make install

Then, optionally, add prefix/bin to your path.  For tcsh:

     setenv PATH ${PATH}:$HOME/Projects/cometsuite/bin


32 vs 64-bit
============

If you need to specify your system's architechure when comiling
CometSuite, do so at the configuration step:

    ./configure ... CFLAGS="-m32" CXXFLAGS="-m32"

where -m32 is for a 32-bit compilation, and can be replaced with -m64
for a 64-bit compliation.

Installed Files
===============

The installed CometSuite consists of the executable files
(rundynamics, syn2ds9, xyz2fits, xyz2psd, xyzinfo) and a few FITS
files to prefix/share.  CometSuite uses the FITS files to lookup a
grain temperature given the grain composition.

SPICE Kernels
=============

Comet and planet positions are obtained via libgetxyz.  See
doc/usersguide.pdf for CometSuite specific information on SPICE
kernels.
