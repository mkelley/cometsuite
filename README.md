# CometSuite

Simulates comet dust and its dynamics.

This is the unmaintained C++ version.  A maintained [Python version](https://github.com/mkelley/pycometsuite) is also available.

The file INSTALL in this directory explains how to build and install the package.

The file NEWS lists news worthy item for users of CometSuite (e.g., version history).
