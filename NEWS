XXXX (YYYY)

* xyz2fits now has a preliminary implementation of nucleus rotation.
  However, the routines need testing.

* integratelist now accepts --planetlookup and --planets as
  command-line inputs.

* RADIUS, LOGRADIUS, and AGE now optinally accept a single value to
  use for all grains, e.g., "RADIUS 10.0".

0.9.2 (14 Jun 2011)

* integratelist, a program to integrate an xyzfile from the initial
  state (as opposed to integratexyz which integrates from the final
  state).  With integratelist, we can create xyzfiles that are just
  lists of grains to be integrated forward in time.

0.9.1 (21 Jan 2011)

* Important bug fix:  Pfunctions set with linear minima and maximum,
  but picked in log space where not properly executed: a call to log()
  should have been a call to log10().  Thus setting size limits with
  RADIUS min max instead of LOGRADIUS min max picked grain sizes from
  10**log(min) to 10**log(max) instead of 10**log10(min) to
  10**log10(max).  I think that radius is the only distribution that
  can be set with linear limits, but is picked in log space, so I
  don't expect any other consequences beyond the RADIUS pfunc.  All
  the other log() calls for pfunc distributions seem legitimate.

* Bug fix: When thermal mode and scattering mode are both disabled in
  xyz2fits, the resulting image was still converted to surface
  brightness (units: sr^-1).  The image should instead be unitless,
  and has been corrected.

* New particle functions JET and IMPACT.

0.9.0 (28 July 2010)

* Important bugfix from the 0.8.x series.  Grain ages in xyz2fits
  results were off by a factor of 86400.  This bug may have been
  introduced in v0.8.2.  v0.9 is working correctly and has been
  verified to work on v0.7 files.

* integratexyz, a program to advance an xyz file by a specified amount
  of time, is ready for use.
