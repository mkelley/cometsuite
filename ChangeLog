	* Dynamical.cc updated poleX to be vector at longitude 0 on the
	equator.  Longitude 0 is defined by the Vernal Equinox.  When the
	pole is the VE, this poleX will be ecliptic north.  Now correctly
	computes longitude.

	* Dynamical.cc, Dynamical.h new vector (and method) poleY, which
	is perpendicular to pole and poleX.

	recognize a requested particle function.

2010-09-30  Michael S. Kelley <msk@astro.umd.edu>

	* Distribution.cc (min, max): Was using log(m) instead of

	* xyzImage.cc (createImages): Only convert to surface brightness
	units if thermalMode or scatteringMode is enabled.

2010-09-27  Michael S. Kelley <msk@astro.umd.edu>

	* pfunctions.cc, pfunctions.h (jet): Added jet() to handle jets.

	* Vej.cc, Vej.h (next): Modified the parameter list to accept time as a
	parameter.  Pass time on to getDirection().

	it to compute the orientation of jets.

	* Vej.cc, Vej.h (period, frequency): Added the parameter _period
	and corresponding functions for rotating jets and the like.  Also
	added the variable _angfreq, without any public access methods.

2010-07-29  Michael S. Kelley <msk@astro.umd.edu>

	* Development version 0.9.1.

	* xyz2fits.cc: Renamed option --fscale to --fscales since it
	really is a vector.  --fscale will still work, though.

	* jettest.cc: Eject the normally distributed velocities over the
	entire nucleus, and change the velocities a bit to make them
	easier to see in the test plot.

	* xyzHist.cc (createPSD): Now catches xyzProject::readError
	like it should.

	* particleWeights.cc (nuclearPsdWeight): Corrected an error in the
	Hanner GSD function.  The formula used (a - a0 / a)^M, but should
	have used (1 - a0 / a)^M.

	* rundyanmics.cc (main, parseCommandLine): Updated to use
	parseCommandLineFlags.

2010-07-28  Michael S. Kelley <msk@astro.umd.edu>

	* Version 0.9.0 released.

2010-07-27  Michael S. Kelley <msk@astro.umd.edu>

	* Development version 0.8.3.

	* paramSet, particleWeights, pfunctions, projection, xyzHist,
	xyzImage, xyzProject, syn2ds9, xyz2fits, xyz2psd: Change vectors
	to valarrays wherever it is appropriate.  This modification ended
	up being difficult because valarray isn't as fully featured as
	vector.  Some valarrays were changed back to vectors.

	* particleWeights.h, particleWeights.cc: The vector _fileScale
	is renamed _fileScales.

	* StringConv.h, StringConv.cc: New class to handle string
	conversions to vectors and valarrays.

	* pfunctions.cc (velocity): Found a possible bug that appeared to
	not set a maximum velocity for the pfunction "velocity limit v0min
	v0max steps", when steps was defined.

	* Dynamical.cc (age): The age image in xyz2fits is too small by a
	factor of 86400, as well as average age in xyzinfo.  Since I can't
	find this problem (xyzstream seems OK to me), I am changing
	particle.age() to take and return the age in seconds, rather than
	days.  The difference between age and istate.t is now a factor of
	-1.

	* planet_lookup.c (planet_lookup_init): Takes nSeconds instead of
	nDays.

	* Integrator.cc (setup): Divide age_max by 86400 in first
	parameter of call to planet_lookup_init.  Fix syndyne setup to
	queue ages and set age_max in units of seconds.

	* Integrator.cc (writeOrbit): Change variable age to ageDays to
	avoid confusion.

	* xyz2fits.cc, xyz2psd.cc (parseCommandLine): Convert the user's
	input to seconds for ageRange.

	* xyz2fits.cc (printParameters, writeParameters): Divide ageRange
	by 86400 before printing/writing.

	* xyzstream (readParticle, writeParticle): Since age has always
	been saved as seconds, remove all the conversions from seconds to
	days.

	* ra15.cc (integrate): Remove some now obsolete 86400s.  Divide
	age() by 86400 for the run-time status strings.  Changed box
	comparison to d^2 <= box^2 to reduce the number of operations per
	particle.

	* accutest.cc (main): Divide age() by 86400 * 365.25 to convert to
	years.

	* particle.cc (next): Divide age() by 86400 when computing Julian
	date, and when outputting debug info

	* particle.cc (operator<<): Divide age() by 86400.

	* pfunctions.cc (age): Still takes ages in days as input, but
	calls to ageDist are now using seconds.

	* paramSet.cc (pFunc): Ensures that _pFunc is all lower-case.

	* paramSet.cc (paramSet): The units of age was listed as days but
	is actually seconds.  The units have been corrected and will now
	be listed as seconds.

	* xyzImage.cc (createImages): age() converted from seconds to
	days.

	* xyzinfo.cc (main): Correctly print out age as days.

	* xyzHist (createPSD): The variables that are used to compute
	angular distance were renamed rx, ry, and rz to avoid confusion
	with an x defined later.

	* paramSet.cc (paramSet, exampleParameters): Set the paramSet
	defaults to the example parameters.  The call to
	exampleParameters() now prints out the default parameterSet.
	Moved all the extended comments into writeParameters() and added
	the extended flag.

2010-07-19  Michael S. Kelley <msk@astro.umd.edu>

	* xyzstream.h: Added some enums for parameter reading/writing.

	* xyzstream.cc (readParticle): Rewritten for optimization.

	* xyzstream.cc (initData): Optimized by adding _parameterOrder and
	_IOMethod.

	* xyzstream.cc, xyzstream.h (readCArray, readIArray, readDArray,
	readVector, readState, readLL, writeCArray, writeIArray,
	writeDArray, writeD, writeVector, writeState, writeLL): New
	functions.

	* test/Makefile: Added savetest target.

	* test/savetest.par: New file for testing save parameter lists.

	* Version 0.8.2 released.

2010-07-10  Michael S. Kelley <msk@astro.umd.edu>

	* paramSet.cc (exampleParameters): Added "label" to the list of
	available save variables.  Described LABEL parameter directive.

	* paramSet.cc (setParameter): Added LABEL.

	* paramSet.cc, paramSet.h (prefix): Added label format functions
	and _labelFormat.

	* particle.cc, particle.h: Added label functions: label(),
	label(string), and generateLabel(long).  Overloaded next() so that
	an optional integer may be passed for the label generation.

	* particle.cc (particle): Initialize label and prefix.

	* particle.cc (operator<<): Added label output.

	* xyzstream.cc (readParticle, writePartcile): Added a new label
	field for particles.

	* Integrator.cc (calculateOne): Added grain number to call to
	_particle.next() and writeOrbit().

	* Integrator (writeOrbit): Added grain number and label
	generation.

2010-06-22  Michael S. Kelley <msk@astro.umd.edu>

	* rundynamics.cc, syn2ds9.cc, vtest.cc, xyz2fits.cc, xyz2psd.cc,
	xyzinfo.cc: Replaced references to PROJECT + VERSION with
	PACKAGE_STRING.

	* rundynamics.cc: PROJECT is now defined as cometsuite in

	* rundynamics.h: Version update for xyzstream.cc.

	* xyzstream.cc: Moved BETA in SAVE parameter list from the first
	  parameter to the third parameter to be consistent with the new
	  default save list for v0.7.3 (this should only affect file I/O
	  speed).

2009-04-02  Michael S. Kelley <msk@astro.umd.edu>

	* Verstion 0.7.3 released.

	* particleWeights.cc: Moved desnity to xyzProject; the weight
	returned by thermalWeight() is now the observed flux from the
	grain in question in units of Jy; nuclearPsdWeight() and
	scatteringWeight() now use radius; I think the old
	nuclearPSDWeight() for the Hanner grain size distribution was off
	by a factor of beta^-2; removed fractalDim, a0 stuff.

	thermally weighted images are in units of MJy/sr.

2009-03-27  Michael S. Kelley <msk@astro.umd.edu>

	* xyzinfo.cc: Now reports average radius; particle read error is
	checked before the cumulative sums are updated (this caused
	xyzinfo to report some weird mean values).

	* everhart.c: Added string.h, which is needed for memset.

	* accutest.cc: Added accutest3.xyz.

	* Vej.cc: Changed formulae to use radius instead of beta ($v_{ej}
	\propto a^{-u1}$); to transform old v0 into new v0 so that the
	same beta values have the same v_ej. v0_new = v0_old *
	sqrt(0.57/graindensity).

2009-03-24  Michael S. Kelley <msk@astro.umd.edu>

	* rundynamics.h: Update for new particle picking (radius instead
	of beta); two new compositions added, amorphous carbon and
	amorphous olivine 50 (50% Mg), their radius-beta conversions are
	computed via Mie theory for solid grains, updated my e-mail
	address.
